# MCP-Server-Client
The project is about a Multi-Client Protocol (MCP) system built using the MCP framework, Langchain MCP adapters, and Langgraph. It involves creating separate servers named "Math" and "Weather" that provide tools via MCP. The client interacts with these servers through agents created with Langgraph and Langchain, enabling commands like math.
